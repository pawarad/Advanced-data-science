The key components of smart grid, the concept of load balancing and its impact have been explained.\n",

    "Here, the author has firstly tried to explain why it is necassary to do prediction of the residential sector. It can be seen that the data obtained has lot of incomplete and unanswered question and the analysis is not possible with such inaccuracies. One prime reason of not being able to predict next day's consumption is the user's behaviour which is a very fluctuating and unreliable factor which cannot be manipulated or influnenced completely, as that nature is influenced because of external factors. For this reason the concept of Home Automation along with Smart grid if implemented proper would be a right fit to be able to make a better output analysis.The author has tried doing an analysis from a micro to macro level  by considering some features as it would be able to tell us in much greater depth which is the most used appliance in the house, using which energy consumption analysis can be done.

    "There are various limitations in this article such as the author considered only one house for the study. It could be better if the author used several houses' data for study. As mentioned earlier, the weather station is 12 km far from the house, the data will not be accurate to study. Other things should be keep in mind such as occupants age, no of occupants. To improve the energy prediction, the better sensors accuracy could help. Also, the optimal location of wireless indoor sensors is not mentioned. Also, the occupant's activity information and the measurement of CO2 by wireless sensors could be useful to improve the prediction. The weather data such as solar radiation and precipitation could also be considered. "
