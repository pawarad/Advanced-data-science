FINAL PROJECT

STOCK TREND ANALYSIS

  The data set is very large ranging from the year 1980 to 2016 so we are going to reduction of data using PCA.

Models

  As it is Time series Analysis we will be using ARIMA for modelling and also we are searching on more algorithms related to Time Series Analysis.

Project Plan

  We will be building the model in first four days after doing research and then we start with deployment and web application in the last six days
